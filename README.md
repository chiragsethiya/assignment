# assignment

I've created a viewset for project (for get, post and patch). These will be used for: a) the dropdown feature to switch project (there we can list all projects by get api)
b) changing area (by patch api) c) adding new project(post api) 

I've also created a viewset for spaces (which can be used to list open workspaces, cabins, meeting rooms etc.)


Below is a screenshot showing list of projects
